//     In Go, a string is a primitive type, which means it is read-only, and every manipulation of it will create a new string. So if I want to concatenate strings many times without knowing the length of the resulting string, what's the best way to do it? The naive way would be: var s string for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ { s += getShortStringFromSomewhere() } return s but that does not seem very efficient.
